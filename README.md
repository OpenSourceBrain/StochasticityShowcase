StochasticityShowcase
=====================

A repository for neuronal models containing stochastic elements (e.g. input currents, syanpses, ion channels) in various formats.

Initial target formats: NeuroML2, PyNN, NEURON...

**NOTE: this is still in development. If you are interested in how models of stochasticity in neuronal models are represented in different simulators, please consider getting in contact (p.gleeson -at- ucl.ac.uk) and helping out with this repository!**
